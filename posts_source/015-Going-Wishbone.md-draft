# Going Wishbone

When doing something for FPGA you probably don't want to write every bit of your
design by yourself. Many people needed to inteface with RAM or SD card
and many people have created FPGA modules that acomplish this task.

This doesn't solve the problem completely &mdash; you still have to learn
to use a module (interface with it), but that should be easier than e.g.
intefracing SDRAM dice directly.

Would't it be great if there was a standard way to communicate between FPGA modules
(so called IP cores)?
