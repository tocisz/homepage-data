# LCD Screens

Nothing really interesting here. I just want to document how to connect two
LCD screens to a blue pill.
Actually it's not a [blue pill](http://wiki.stm32duino.com/index.php?title=Blue_Pill).
It's [black](http://wiki.stm32duino.com/index.php?title=Black_Pill).
Some pins are connected differently. E.g. onboard LED is not on `PC13`,
but on `PB12`.

## ST7735 1.8'' TFT LCD

This one has `128`x`160` resolution.

Connect as follows.

```
STM32  3.3 --- VCC  LCD
       GND --- GND
       AO  --- CS
       A1  --- RESET
       C13 --- AO
       A7  --- SDA
       A5  --- SCK
       3.3 --- LED
```

I used [Adafruit_GFX library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library)
version [ported to STM32](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/tree/master/STM32F1/libraries/Adafruit_GFX_AS).
To test it I took example from original Adafruit library and changed pin numbers.

## ILI93.. 2.4'' TFT LCD

This one has `320`x`240` resolution and is touch sensitive. Image can be sent
serially or by 8-bit data bus. I used data bus for the speed sake.

Adafruit library port can be found [here](https://github.com/iwalpola/Adafruit_ILI9341_8bit_STM).
It was modified by an author of [this instructable](https://www.instructables.com/id/Fast-Portable-and-Affordable-Oscilloscope-and-Indu/) to use different pins. Unfortunately I couldn't find it on Github.
There is [a zip file to download](https://cdn.instructables.com/ORIG/F93/WPIS/J1CENFTO/F93WPISJ1CENFTO.zip).

An author of the first library admits that [this one](https://github.com/stevstrong/Adafruit_TFTLCD_8bit_STM32) is better.
I'm thinking about porting oscilloscope code to it.

Some documentation about display and drivers can be found [here](http://misc.ws/2013/11/08/touch-screen-shield-for-arduino-uno/).
